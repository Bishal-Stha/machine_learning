1. Linear Algebra in Real Life
Objective: Apply matrix operations to a real-world scenario.
Problem:
A small caf√© tracks its daily sales for three products: coffee, sandwiches, and cakes. The sales for three days are recorded as:
Day 1: [100 coffees, 50 sandwiches, 30 cakes]
Day 2: [120 coffees, 70 sandwiches, 40 cakes]
Day 3: [90 coffees, 60 sandwiches, 20 cakes]
The prices for the products are:
Coffee: $2 each
Sandwich: $5 each
Cake: $4 each
Represent the sales and prices as matrices.
Compute the total revenue for each day using matrix multiplication.
Calculate the transpose of the sales matrix and explain its significance.
